\runsubsection{Word Predictor}
\descript{| Java \\ proof of use-case of Tries in browsers' autocomplete features}
\begin{tightemize}
\item implemented a Trie data structure to allow efficient storage, access, and manipulation of strings and used an instance of a Trie to add words to it from a dictionary (parsing)
\item set up a GUI with a DocumentListener object to provide live updates of user inputs to the GUI
\item displayed possible words from the Trie (using a depth-first search graph-traversal) to emulate auto-complete 
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{The Periodic Table: Dynamic Programming}
\descript{| C++ \\ proof of concept showing overlap between periodic chemistry and dsa}
\begin{tightemize}
\item based on an observed parallel between the Periodic Table and the paradigm of dynamic programming
\item using the closest noble gas appearing prior to a specific element, electronic configs were generated using the Aufbau principle
\item aspects inside an atom (shells, subshells, electrons, etc.) were modeled with various classes organized into different C header files
